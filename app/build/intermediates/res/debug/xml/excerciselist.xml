			<string>Stand up straight with your feet firmly planted on the ground approximately shoulder width apart. To help maintain a straight back as you perform the exercise, it&apos;s a good idea to focus on an object directly ahead of you at eye level. Contract your abdominal muscles as you bend your legs at the knees. Either stretch your arms out ahead of you, lightly position your hands behind your ears or hold your arms at your side as you slowly lower yourself into a squatting position. Lower your body to a position where your thighs are almost parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position and repeat.</string>

Then, return to your starting position and lower yourself towards the ground. The next step is then to push up and rotate until your left hand is now pointing towards the ceiling.</string>

The next step is to position your elbow under your shoulder and to prop up your upper body on your left elbow and forearm. Contract your abdominal muscles and raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your ankles to your shoulders. Whilst holding this position, remember to breathe deeply. The next step is to repeat this process using the other side of your body.</string>
